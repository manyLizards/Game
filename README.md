# Game
So far, this is a simple catch the falling objects game with simple shapes. Currently working on a way for users to play without having to download anything. For now, if you'd like to play, you'll have to download a couple things.

## Step 1: Install Python
Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Step 2: Install Pygame
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Powershell, or Git Bash) and run the following command to install Pygame:

`pip install pygame`

## Step 3: Clone or Download the Game
Clone the repository using:
`git clone https://github.com/manyLizards/Game`

OR

Download the ZIP file and extract it.

## Step 4: Run the game
Navigate to the folder containing game.py in the terminal and run the game by typing

`python game.py`

# Features and Updates
You can always check upcoming updates within the game file `game.py` at the top of the file.

Right now I am currently working on a way to format the game so users/players do not have to download python or pygame.

## UPDATE 12/1/24
The speed of the falling objects now increases every time one is caught.
